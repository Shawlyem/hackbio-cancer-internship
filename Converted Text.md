KINASES; In Cancer Pathogenesis and Therapy

In recent years, about 70 protein kinase inhibitors have been approved by the FDA for cancer treatment. This is a fraction of the over 120 protein kinase inhibitors that have been approved the world over for treatment of various diseases \[1]. Kinases are enzymes that carryout transfer of high-energy phosphate groups from ATP to specific substrates such as serine, threonine, tyrosine or histidine residues in proteins. There are approximately 560 protein kinases which constitute about 2% of the total human genome \[2], of these 560 protein kinases, about 500 are eukaryotic and share sequence similarities while the over 60 remaining are atypical with no sequence similarities \[3].

The phosphorylation activities of kinases influence enzyme activities \[4] and therefore play an important role in the regulation of cellular functions such as growth, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis \[5,6], as well as initiation of primary oncogenic transformations and tumor maintenance \[7]. The p53 receptor which functions to halt gene replication and cell cycle, activates DNA repair and fosters cell death is stimulated through phosphorylation activities of kinases. Excesses in the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation pathway results in chronic inactivation of the p53 protein and also makes a cell cancerous \[8].

Kinase inhibitors are the largest and most approved category of drugs for tumor treatment \[9]. The 2 major categories of kinase inhibitors that are used in tumor treatment are small-molecule kinase inhibitors (SMKIs) and the larger molecules which include monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), nanobodies and peptides. The epidermal growth factor (EGFR) family of protein kinase inhibitors represent the most developed kinase targets with about 18 inhibitors including mAbs and their derivatives. SMKIs that target the EGFR kinases have been developed to overcome resistance caused by mutations in this family of kinases \[10]. To increase tissue penetrability and bioavailability of kinase inhibitors, mAb derivatives such as nanobodies and peptides have been designed as possible replacements for the larger traditional antibodies \[11].

New advancements in development of targets for kinases include kinase degraders and protein kinase interactors. Degraders are made up of proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), lysosome-targeting chimeras (LYTACs) and hydrophobic tagging technologies \[12]. Conversely, protein kinase interactors act by disrupting kinase-substrate interactions without affecting enzymatic activity \[13]. The key challenge in the use of SMKIs for cancer treatment is the development of acquired resistance through on-target mutations and off-target resistance mechanisms. Strategies to overcome this challenge include development of SMKIs which target different sites of EGFR kinases and those which target new variant targets \[1].
